**KFuji RGB-DS Database: Fuji Apple Multi-Modal Images for Fruit Detection with Color, Depth and Range-Corrected IR Data** is a dataset for object detection and monocular depth estimation tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 3011 images with 41505 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*apple*).

Images in the KFuji RGB-DS dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 110 (4% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *cropped-train* (1857 images), *cropped-test* (579 images), *cropped-val* (465 images), and *original_images* (110 images). Additionally, every channel of the image is grouped by its ***im_id***. Explore image groups in supervisely.. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Universitat de Lleida, Spain and Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, Spain.
